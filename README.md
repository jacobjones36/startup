I added the login feature so you can login if you have an account or you can create one. The info the admin adds is saved and retrieved from the database and you have to login in order to add anything. Stores and retrieves the credentials from the database.


I added a quote to the main page using fetch. I updated the schedule and week at glace to add endpoints to each of them. Added the index.js file to serve the front end code through express and call the new endpoints from this code. Used node.js to debug it as I worked. 



My dad has been the coach of the soccer team at my high school since I was a freshman there. Ever since we remember the high school has never had an athletic page for any of the sports that actually works and is used. I want to create a website that someday my dad can actually use to get information out and someday build a better program there. I want it to be accessible by him and other coaches/admin to edit the schedule and other things that would be useful for an athletics page. I want it to be very user friendly so it is appealing for people to look at and easy to find the information they are looking for. I will use html to make very basic. The css to make it beautiful. And the javascript to make it so they can update the information on it as well as a login feature to allow only certain people to access the admin features.
